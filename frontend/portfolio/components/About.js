          Hello! I'm Anisha S, a passionate and curious tech enthusiast who loves building,
          designing, and exploring. I enjoy working on innovative ideas, solving real-world
          problems, and learning new tools and technologies along the way.
          <br /><br />
          Over time, I've worked on diverse projects that helped me grow as a problem solver,
          team player, and lifelong learner. I enjoy blending logic with creativity, and Iâ€™m always
          open to exploring new domains â€” from design to development, and everything in between.
          Outside of coding, youâ€™ll find me diving into programming, experimenting with UI/UX concepts.
        </p>
